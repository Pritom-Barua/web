  Dribbling the Ball

</h2>
  
  To dribble the ball, you'll need to touch the ball with your fingertips. If you dribble the palm with your hands, you'll end up slapping the ball instead. This gives you control over more surface area of the basketball. You'll need to have your knees bent and get down pretty low while still having your back straight. Keep your head up too. This gives you more control over the ball. Start bouncing the ball and keep your hand on top of the ball. Keep the ball low and bounce it hard so you can dribble it faster and more efficiently.

    Shooting The Ball
  </h2>
  
  To shoot the ball, you'll need a bit more skill. You'll want the ball at chest level, while keeping your palm hovering at the center of the ball. Your fingertips of your natural hand(the hand you write with))will be touching the ball, not your palm though. You'll want your other hand to be on the other side of the ball. Your other hand can be holding the ball normally. Then, you'll want to shoot the ball from about the forehead straight at the basket. Before releasing the ball, make sure your index finger and middle finger push the ball off last so the ball can be centered. Shoot the ball higher up into the air so the ball can have more arc.
